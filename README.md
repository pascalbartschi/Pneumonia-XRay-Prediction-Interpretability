# Pneumonia X-Ray Prediction and Interpretability

This project focuses on building a CNN classifier to predict pneumonia from chest X-ray images and applying interpretability techniques like Integrated Gradients and Grad-CAM to understand the model's predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia?resource=download). Download the dataset and place it in the `data` folder.

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reproducing Results

1. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` folder.
2. Follow the steps in the project files to preprocess the data, train the CNN, and apply interpretability techniques.
